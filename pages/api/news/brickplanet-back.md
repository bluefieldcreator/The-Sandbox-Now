# BrickPlanet has returned!

BrickPlanet is once again back in town, this time with one of the shortest shutdowns in it is history.

Not many people are pleased with it is comeback though. Many still believing that Isaac just wants to commit another exit scam. Others saying it is finally coming back.

Even though even Isaac said that it was the final comeback, he killed, it and brought it back... once again.

This practice of killing and reviving has been common within the BrickPlanet community. One day Isaac doesn't feel like working on BrickPlanet and shuts it down completely for a few months, just to bring it back later on.

## The 7th Iteration
BrickPlanet's 7th iteration was not a success. It was a failure. In fact, Isaac shut it down before even releasing it. Many donated while the website was in development, and many have not gotten their refunds yet. Including some of the former most active members like **Shunk**, who lost all faith upon the shut-down.

The excuse for not getting a refund was that the website was that it was their fault for even donating in the first place.

Other users claim that the reason some refunds were not done was because Isaac was still going to deliver an end product.

Overall the majority of the community seems to be opposing another BrickPlanet, and a small minority keeps looking forward it. Has BrickPlanet finally reached it is final iteration?

## The 8th Iteration
BrickPlanet "final" comeback is allegedly happening now. And with the website almost finished, there's fears that Isaac might commit another exit scam soon. 

But what worries the most to users, is the real reason for his comeback. 

When BrickPlanet shut down, a new team appeared within the community. **Buildaverse**, who would take over the project and continue "its legacy" while trying to not be related to BrickPlanet.

While Buildaverse seemed like a good idea, it wasn't executed properly, using existing code and resources as well as discriminating staff members who are part of other communities asides Buildaverse are some of the most recent incidents.

Some developers of Buildaverse have claimed using the BrickPlanet client on Buildaverse, which could have been one of the reasons for Isaac's return.
